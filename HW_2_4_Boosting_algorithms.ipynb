Це означає, що модель добре натренувалась і добре узагальнює дані. В порівнянні з `XGBoost` з оптимальними гіперпараметрами знайденими за допомогою `Hyperopt` `94,96%` на тренувальних даних та `93,71%` на валідаційних даних можна сказати що обидві моделі показали майже однакові результати і можуть бути використані обидві."
